            <p>“I’m detransitioning,” Kay says for the fifth time that
            day.</p>
            <p>“Okay, Kay,” I respond without looking up from my book. I
            smile a little to myself, appreciating the rhyme.</p>
            <p>“No, I’m serious.” I sigh, arching my back and sitting
            up.</p>
            <p>She doesn’t look serious; when Kay is serious, she looks
            pissed. Right now, she has a carefully neutral expression,
            which she tends to adopt when she’s trying not to cry.</p>
            <p>“Lilith,” she whines. It’s taking me too long to
            respond.</p>
            <p>“You’re not detransitioning. That would be cringe,” I
            offer, but her face doesn’t change. “It’s not a funny
            bit.”</p>
            <p>While I scramble for something else to say, she stares
            down at her hands.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>“What is this, a commercial for jeans?”</p>
            <p>“Who <em>is</em> she?”</p>
            <p>“She’s literally so slay.”</p>
            <p>Mia lounges on the other half of the bench while I
            stare.</p>
            <p>The object of our appreciation turns, scanning around for
            a moment until her gaze lands on us. I politely turn my head
            about 5 degrees to the right. I could conceivably be looking
            at a dog or a tree somewhere in the middle distance.</p>
            <p>The stranger is far less polite than I.</p>
            <p>“Hey! Enjoying the view?”</p>
            <p>Who <em>does</em> that? Then again, I probably shouldn’t
            be ogling strangers in the park like some lech.</p>
            <p>“Sorry! Your outfit is just really cute!”</p>
            <p>Mia gives me a look.</p>
            <p>“What? Here, give me a second.” Oh no. She’s coming over.
            I fight the urge to bury my head in my hands.</p>
            <p>“Hi. I’m Brendan,” says Brendan, coming to a stop a
            respectful ten feet away.</p>
            <p>I’m so fucking cancelled. I open my mouth, but Mia gets
            there first.</p>
            <p>“Sorry Brendan, we thought you were a girl. You’re not,
            right?”</p>
            <p>“No. Common mistake, I guess.”</p>
            <p>“You sure? I’ve got some estrogen you could try.”</p>
            <p>Mia is grinning like a maniac. Goddamnit.</p>
            <p>“Thanks for the offer, but I’ve found it doesn’t agree
            with me.”</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“I’m a trans guy.”</p>
            <p>I feel my face turning a bright red as Mia throws her
            head back and cackles.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It’s 12:14am, and I’m outside smoking from the bong. I
            can never sleep this early. My eyes, iridescent like a
            cat’s, stare out over the street from the landing outside my
            apartment building. No one is around.</p>
            <p>No one is ever around when I feel like this.</p>
            <hr />

            <hr />
            <p>I take another hit and pass the joint back. Staring at
            the sky, I ask, “Is there anything you miss about being a
            guy?” There are only a few stars visible, though earlier I
            saw a plane fly overhead. Now nothing moves.</p>
            <p>“I miss dating straight women.”</p>
            <p>I laugh and look over at her. “Yeah, like me.”</p>
            <p>Kay frowns. “I’m <em>serious</em>, Lil.”</p>
            <p>“You’re <em>too</em> serious. Remember what I said the
            other day? Being trans is just like, an inherently funny
            thing to do.”</p>
            <p>“But I’m not <em>trying</em> to be funny!” She sits up.
            There’s a desperation in her voice, and it cracks a bit at
            the end of her sentence. I wince, and immediately regret it.
            The last thing this situation needs is secondhand voice
            dysphoria.</p>
            <p>But she doesn’t seem to notice. Instead, she lies back
            and says, “I guess trying to be funny usually isn’t
            funny.”</p>
            <p>“Exactly. We’re comediennes,” I shoot back, rolling over
            to put my arm on her stomach.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It doesn’t make sense for me to be this way. I flinch
            whenever Amber moves suddenly, expecting to get hit. I stare
            longingly at the ropes backstage at work. It’s not like
            anyone has ever hit me, or told me I should die — no one
            except me, I guess.</p>
            <p>How’d I get this fucked up?</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Inside it’s somehow 1:20am. I avoid eye contact with the
            mirror as I stand up, bending low over the sink to wash my
            hands. As I reach for the door handle, I finally think of
            something to say.</p>
            <p>“So I was in the park the other day, and—”</p>
            <p>Fuck. Amber’s asleep on the couch. I took too long. I
            look at my watch, but I don’t remember when I last checked
            it. It’s 11:04pm now, for whatever that’s worth.</p>
            <p>I turn off the TV, which is paused in the middle of an
            episode of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and poke the sleeping girl
            gently on the cheek. When that does nothing, I grab her
            shoulder and give it a shake.</p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>“You fell asleep on the couch. Come on, come get in
            bed.”</p>
