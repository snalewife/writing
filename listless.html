            <p>“I’m detransitioning,” Kay says for the fifth time that
            day.</p>
            <p>“Okay, Kay,” I respond without looking up from my book. I
            smile a little to myself, appreciating the rhyme.</p>
            <p>“No, I’m serious.”</p>
            <p>I sigh, arching my back and sitting up.</p>
            <p>She doesn’t look serious; when Kay is serious, she looks
            pissed. Right now, she has a carefully neutral expression,
            which she often wears when she’s trying not to cry.</p>
            <p>“Lilith,” she whines. It’s taking me too long to
            respond.</p>
            <p>“You’re not detransitioning. That would be cringe,” I
            offer, but her face doesn’t change. “This isn’t a funny
            bit.”</p>
            <p>While I scramble for something else to say, she stares
            down at her hands.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>“What is this, a commercial for jeans?”</p>
            <p>“Who <em>is</em> she?”</p>
            <p>“She’s literally so slay.”</p>
            <p>Kay lounges on the other half of the bench while I
            stare.</p>
            <p>The object of our appreciation turns, scanning around for
            a moment until her gaze lands right on us. I politely turn
            my head about 5 degrees to the left. I could conceivably be
            looking at a dog or a tree somewhere in the middle
            distance.</p>
            <p>The stranger is far less polite than I.</p>
            <p>“Hey! Enjoying the view?”</p>
            <p>Who <em>does</em> that? Then again, I probably shouldn’t
            be ogling people in the park like some lech.</p>
            <p>“Sorry! Your outfit is just really cute!”</p>
            <p>Kay gives me a look.</p>
            <p>“What? Here, give me a second!” Oh no. She’s coming over.
            I fight the urge to bury my head in my hands.</p>
            <p>“Hi. I’m Brayden,” says Brayden, coming to a stop a
            respectful ten feet away.</p>
            <p>I’m so fucking cancelled. I open my mouth, but Kay gets
            there first.</p>
            <p>“Sorry Brayden, we thought you were a girl. You’re not,
            right?”</p>
            <p>“No. Common mistake, I guess.”</p>
            <p>“You sure? I’ve got some estrogen you could try.” Kay is
            leaning forward and grinning like a maniac. Goddamnit.</p>
            <p>“Thanks for the offer, but I’ve found it doesn’t agree
            with me.”</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“I’m a trans guy.”</p>
            <p>I feel my face turning a bright red as Kay throws her
            head back and cackles.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It’s 12:14am, and I’m outside smoking from the bong. I
            can never sleep this early. My eyes, iridescent like a
            cat’s, stare out over the street from the landing outside my
            apartment building. No one is around.</p>
            <p>No one is ever around when I feel like this.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Brayden’s wings are enormous. They’ve been modestly
            hidden beneath his oversized shirt, but when he takes it off
            to show us his scars — <em>who does that? in a bar??</em> —
            they unfurl behind and above his head, resplendent and
            black-feathered.</p>
            <p>I want to cry just looking at them.</p>
            <p>As he lets them loose, a server walks behind him, and has
            to duck low over the tray of drinks she’s carrying. She
            shoots him a look, and he apologizes with the goofy charisma
            I’m learning is his trademark.</p>
            <p>“Wow, those are crazy,” says Kay, looking him up and
            down.</p>
            <p>“Which, the scars or the wings?” He asks, turning his
            radiant smile on her.</p>
            <p>“Yes,” she replies, looking up from his abs to meet his
            playful gaze.</p>
            <p>I’m surprised either of them notice a half hour later
            when I get up to pay my tab.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I take another hit and pass the joint back. Staring at
            the sky, I ask, “Is there anything you miss about being a
            guy?” There are only a few stars visible, though earlier I
            saw a plane fly overhead. Now, nothing moves.</p>
            <p>“I miss dating straight women.”</p>
            <p>I laugh and look over at her. “Yeah, like me.”</p>
            <p>Kay frowns. “I’m <em>serious</em>, Lil.”</p>
            <p>“You’re <em>too</em> serious. Remember what Elle said the
            other day? Being trans is just like, an inherently funny
            thing to do.”</p>
            <p>“But I’m not <em>trying</em> to be funny!” She sits up.
            There’s a desperation in her voice, and it cracks a bit at
            the end of her sentence. I wince, and immediately regret it.
            The last thing this situation needs is secondhand voice
            dysphoria.</p>
            <p>But she doesn’t seem to notice. Instead, she lies back
            and says, “I guess trying to be funny usually isn’t
            funny.”</p>
            <p>“Exactly. We’re comediennes,” I shoot back, rolling over
            to put my arm on her stomach. I feel it rise and fall, and
            convince myself for a moment that I can feel the gentle
            suction there as she breathes through her skin.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I avoid eye contact with the mirror as I stand up,
            bending low over the sink to wash my hands. As I reach for
            the door handle, I finally think of something to say.</p>
            <p>“So I was in the park the other day, and—”</p>
            <p>Fuck. Amber’s asleep on the couch. I took too long.</p>
            <p>I turn off the TV, which is paused in the middle of an
            episode of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and poke her gently on the
            cheek. When that does nothing, I grab her shoulder and give
            it a shake.</p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>“You fell asleep on the couch. Come on, come get in
            bed.”</p>
