            <h2>Grey’s Astronomy</h2>
            <p><em>The human body is an incredibly complex system. We
            don’t entirely know how it works. There are mysteries around
            every corner.</em></p>
            <p><em>A spaceship is a lot like the human body. Cells
            rushing around from place to place, doing their jobs to keep
            us up and running. But there are no mysteries. Everything
            works the way it was designed to.</em></p>
            <p><em>Until it doesn’t.</em></p>

            <p>The metal floor was cold under Meredith’s bare feet. She
            shoved them into her slippers and stood up from her
            bunk.</p>
            <p>“It’s definitely not time yet. Where are you going?” came
            a voice from behind her. She turned to gaze at Derek, whose
            face was pressed into his pillow. His salt-and-pepper hair
            was sticking up at a jaunty angle.</p>
            <p>“I have to pee,” she whispered.</p>
            <p>In the bathroom, she stared down at the water in the sink
            as it circled the drain. Then, she met her own eyes in the
            mirror.</p>
            <p>“What are <em>you</em> looking at?”</p>
            <p>Abruptly, she was on the floor. No, the wall. That was
            probably a bad noise her shoulder had made…</p>
            <p>When she came to, she knew her shoulder was dislocated.
            She recognized the loose feeling and the dull, steady pain
            from when she had broken her toe on a doorframe when she was
            twelve.</p>
            <p>She lay crumpled in a heap on the floor (actually the
            floor this time), with her busted arm pinned under her
            torso.</p>
            <p>What on Earth was <em>that</em>?</p>
