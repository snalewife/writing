            <h2>Grey’s Astronomy</h2>
            <p><em>The human body is an incredibly complex system. We
            don’t entirely know how it works. There are mysteries around
            every corner.</em></p>
            <p>The metal floor was cold under Meredith Grey’s bare feet.
            She shoved them into her slippers and stood up from her
            bunk.</p>
            <p>“It’s definitely not time yet. Where are you going?” came
            a voice from behind her. She turned to gaze at Derek, whose
            face was pressed into his pillow. His salt-and-pepper hair
            was sticking up at a jaunty angle.</p>
            <p>“I have to pee,” she whispered.</p>
            <p><em>A spaceship is a lot like the human body. Cells
            rushing around from place to place, doing their jobs to keep
            us up and running. But there are no mysteries. Everything
            works the way it was designed to.</em></p>
            <p>In the bathroom, she stared down at the water in the sink
            as it circled the drain. Then, she met her own eyes in the
            mirror.</p>
            <p>“What are <em>you</em> looking at?”</p>
            <p>Abruptly, she was on the floor. No, the wall. That was
            probably a bad noise her shoulder had made…</p>
            <p>When she came to, she knew her shoulder was dislocated.
            She recognized the loose feeling and the dull, steady pain
            from when she had broken her toe on a doorframe when she was
            twelve.</p>
            <p>She lay crumpled in a heap on the floor (actually the
            floor this time), with her busted arm pinned under her
            torso.</p>
            <p><em>Until it doesn’t.</em></p>
            <hr />
            <img

            alt="image" />
            <hr />
            <p>The common area of the engineers’ quarters was buzzing
            with activity. Chief Engineer Webber was shouting commands
            left and right.</p>
            <p>“Alright people, you know the drill. Maintaining
            pressurization is the priority, and after that, life support
            systems. Shepherd, I want a full scan of the hull, pull
            whoever you need to place patches. Torres, Stevens, make
            sure our oxygen tanks are intact. Hunt, Bailey, Karev, check
            on the stiffs.”</p>
            <p>Meredith’s arm was (un)comfortably dangling in a sling
            she had fashioned from a t-shirt. Derek gave her a kiss on
            the forehead as he hustled past, heading for the aft control
            station.</p>
            <p>Cristina entered the common area and looked around.
            Meredith avoided eye contact. She felt bad that she had been
            avoiding her best friend, but that didn’t stop her from
            doing it.</p>
            <p>It was a silly impulse. Obviously Cristina saw her, and
            when Meredith glanced up she saw the other woman making a
            beeline for her.</p>
            <p>“What happened to you? Nevermind, don’t answer that.
            Wanna see something cool?”</p>
            <p>Meredith opened her mouth, closed it again, and thought
            for a moment.</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>Cristina grabbed her by the hand and led her out of the
            room at a trot.</p>
            <p>They turned down hallway after hallway until at last they
            arrived at the thruster control room. Or, arrived at the
            outside of it.</p>
            <p>Where there was normally an open, hexagonal doorway into
            the room, a heavy blast door now stood. There was a small
            square of reinforced glass in the center of it, and Cristina
            led her right up to it, then pointed wordlessly at the
            window.</p>
            <p>The thruster control room was unrecognizable. One of the
            consoles was missing entirely, and there were shredded wires
            and warped sheets of metal floating roughly where it had
            stood. And there was a big rock sticking through the
            floor.</p>
            <p>Meredith looked at Cristina, who turned to meet her eyes
            with a gleeful expression on her face. Over Cristina’s
            shoulder, she noticed a compartment on the wall that was
            uncharacteristically lying open. Inside was a rack of
            compression suits with matching helmets, intended for
            performing external repairs to the ship.</p>
            <p>Cristina followed her gaze and nodded excitedly. Then,
            they both turned to look back through the window.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Bailey was already calling up the schematics for the
            suspension pods on her overlay as she bustled down the
            corridor. Karev jogged beside her like a pilot fish
            following a shark around. Hunt had already disappeared
            around a corner at a sprint.</p>
            <p>Bailey was mid-sentence, explaining her thought process
            for Karev’s benefit. “Now, we can do a lot from the computer
            controls, but if there’s something wrong with the pods
            themselves, what do we do?”</p>
            <p>Karev gave her a blank look. She sighed.</p>
            <p>“If there’s something wrong with the pods, we’re gonna
            need a <em>coolant guy</em>.”</p>
            <p>She tried not to think about what that might mean for
            her, personally.</p>
            <p>They turned the corner into the control room for the
            suspension pods and saw Hunt already bent over a console,
            his orange hair glistening with sweat.</p>
            <p>Bailey immediately got to work at the other console,
            still mentally rotating the schematic for the pods while
            subvocalizing status report commands to be executed by the
            console.</p>
            <p>Glancing over, she noticed that Hunt was cursing under
            his breath, and had the front plate off of his console,
            exposing the electronics underneath. He already had a
            screwdriver in hand, but would need more tools if he was
            about to dig around in there. Silently, Bailey motioned to
            Karev to bring a toolbox from the supply closet around the
            corner.</p>
            <p>From there, she started to get lost in the work. There
            was a comfortable rhythm to dispatching a command, scanning
            through the reports that came back for any signs that
            something was out of the ordinary, and verifying visually
            that the relevant system seemed to be functioning in the
            nearest pod.</p>
            <p>She had almost forgotten that she had sent Karev out of
            the room until she heard a loud smacking noise to her left,
            and looked over to see Hunt holding his hand and Karev
            reeling from what was likely a punch.</p>
            <p>“What on Earth are you doing, Engineer Hunt?” She
            exclaimed furiously. They’d had some problems in the past,
            but this was a bridge too far.</p>
            <p>“You startled me,” mumbled Hunt.</p>
            <p>“Karev, are you okay?” Bailey was too upset to multitask,
            momentarily abandoning her status reports.</p>
            <p>“Fuck,” said Karev, spitting out some blood onto the
            metal floor.</p>
            <p>“Apologize,” Bailey said through gritted teeth. She had
            noticed how quickly Hunt had gone back to what he was doing,
            without even thanking Karev for the toolbox.</p>
            <p>“No,” Hunt said without looking up. “Don’t sneak up on
            people, Karev.”</p>
            <p>Bailey was momentarily at a loss for words, doing her
            best not to be visibly taken aback. However, this was no
            time for an interpersonal conflict.</p>
            <p>“People punching people, what is that about?” she
            muttered, returning to her work.</p>
            <p>Karev had recovered by now, and went off into the long
            room with the suspension pods.</p>
            <p>“Um, guys?” his voice came through the doorway.</p>
            <p>Bailey dropped what she was doing and ran in there with
            him. She saw immediately what he was looking at. The third
            pod from the end on the right hand side had a streak of
            liquid running down the inside of its transparent front. The
            pods were at an angle, and as they watched, a drop of liquid
            fell onto the nose of the man inside.</p>
            <p>Bailey looked at Karev. “I think we need a coolant guy,”
            he said.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Lexi liked robots. They were like people, but unlike
            people, they did what you wanted them to. Most of the
            time.</p>
            <p>Right now, the autoforklift was giving her a world of
            trouble. It had been in use during the abrupt deceleration,
            and had collided rather unfortunately with another machine.
            Since then, she’d run every diagnostic in the system menu,
            and it was still misbehaving.</p>
            <p>This time wouldn’t be any different, she knew. She’d just
            finished re-flashing the machine’s firmware, but all she’d
            done was add a bunch of logging statements everywhere. If
            there was going to be an error message, surely she would see
            it.</p>
            <p>“Tell me your secrets, you jerk,” she mumbled, patting
            the thing’s stout chassis. As she queued up the test program
            on her overlay, however, a ruggedly masculine voice startled
            her.</p>
            <p>“I hear you catch more flies with honey, honey.” Mark was
            standing in the doorway with a charming, if irritating, grin
            splitting his broad face wide open.</p>
            <p>Lexi absentmindedly tucked a strand of hair behind her
            ear. “You shouldn’t sneak up on people. It’s — it’s
            rude.”</p>
            <p>This was <em>so</em> not what she needed right now.</p>
            <p>“I’m not rude. I’m a perfect gentleman.” Mark cocked his
            head to one side, and the stupid grin intensified.</p>
            <p>“Whatever. Why are you here?”</p>
            <p>“I heard about your friend there and thought you could
            use some help. You figure out what’s wrong with it yet?”</p>
            <p>Lexi scowled. “No. Every time, it’s the same thing, he
            just freaks out—”</p>
            <p>“<em>He</em>? Lexi, come on. I was joking when I called
            it your friend. You know they’re not people, right?”</p>
            <p>She felt her cheeks turning red and abruptly turned away
            from him. “Obviously. I know that. You just — after working
            on them for a while — I mean, each machine has a
            personality, in a way — I know they’re not people.” Her face
            was hot with embarrassment.</p>
            <p>“Hey, chill out. It’s cute. Hell, I like to give them
            names. Some of them, at least.”</p>
            <p>Lexi turned back around hesitantly, only to find Mark
            much closer than she expected. He was inspecting the manual
            controls on the autoforklift, which happened to be <em>right
            next to her face</em>.</p>
            <p>Seeing the machine, she was reminded of her frustration.
            “We should name this one ‘Jerky McJerkface’.” Mark turned to
            look at her with a playfully puzzled expression. “Or, um,
            something funnier than that,” she rushed out, blushing even
            more.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The splicer rotated gently in the air — no, the space —
            in front of Meredith’s face. Distantly, she noted its
            movement, and registered vaguely that she ought to be
            repairing the seam between the metal sheet she was
            magnetically stuck to and the one next to it.</p>
            <p>“Mer?” came Cristina’s distracted voice over the
            communicator, a voice she loved. See? She could still
            love.</p>
            <p>“Hm?”</p>
            <p>“What have you been up to? I feel like we haven’t talked
            in a while.”</p>
            <p>“Oh.” Right. She had definitely noticed. Meredith took a
            deep breath. “Yeah, sorry. I’ve just been so busy with this
            project the Chief has me and Derek working on.”</p>
            <p>“Right, right. I should have a project,” Cristina said
            absentmindedly. “How <em>is</em> Derek?”</p>
            <p>“What? Cristina, what is this?”</p>
            <p>Her friend turned her head around in her spacesuit, and
            when she saw the expression on Meredith’s face, turned the
            rest of her body around too.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean, what? Is something wrong?”</p>
            <p>“No, we just don’t have to always talk about
            everything!”</p>
            <p>“Is this about me taking credit for fixing the overlay
            thing? Because that wasn’t my fault, Bailey just said good
            job and then I couldn’t correct her because the conversation
            moved on.”</p>
            <p>“Cristina.”</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>Meredith gave her a meaningful glance.</p>
            <p>“Oh my god you’re all dark and stormy again? But I
            thought things were good, <em>you</em> said you were doing
            good!”</p>
            <p>“I lied.”</p>
            <p>“I’m your person, Meredith. Or, I mean, I <em>am</em>
            your person, right?”</p>
            <p>“Of course, what am I gonna do, talk to Derek?”</p>
            <p>“This isn’t a joke!”</p>
            <p>She finally turned her head away from the seam to see a
            look of genuine hurt on Cristina’s face.</p>
            <p>“Cristina —”</p>
            <p>She was cut off by the squeaky sound of warping metal.
            The two women turned their heads in unison to look, then
            turned to look back at each other. Meredith opened her mouth
            and turned back as if to say more, but was interrupted by an
            even louder squeal.</p>
            <p>“Come on, help me with this!” Cristina was already firing
            the thrusters on her suit downward to stabilize the bent
            panel of the ships hull between them, and welding with the
            hand that wasn’t keeping her anchored to a ladder rung.</p>
            <p>Meredith looked around her in a way that was totally not
            despondent, and activated her own suit’s thrusters.</p>
